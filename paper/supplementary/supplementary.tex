\subsection{Additional Experimental Details}

\subsubsection{Dataset Preprocessing}
The PBMC-10k dataset used in our experiments consists of 11,990 cells from 2 batches. Data preprocessing follows standard single-cell analysis protocols:
\begin{itemize}
\item Quality control: removal of cells with $<$ 200 or $>$ 5000 expressed genes
\item Normalization: total-count normalization to 10,000 reads per cell
\item Log transformation: $\log(x + 1)$ transformation
\item Gene selection: intersection with our 1,000-gene vocabulary
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Additional Results}

\subsubsection{Computational Requirements}
Evaluation was performed on a single GPU with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item GPU: NVIDIA RTX A6000
\item Memory usage: Approximately 8GB VRAM
\item Processing time: 30 seconds for full integration pipeline

\subsubsection{Ablation Study Details}
Component contribution analysis shows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Full BioFormer: NMI = 0.7792
\item Without MoE: NMI = 0.7234 (-7.2\%)
\item With positional embeddings: NMI = 0.7456 (-4.3\%)
\item Standard transformer: NMI = 0.6891 (-11.6\%)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gene Vocabulary}
The fixed gene vocabulary consists of 1,000 highly variable genes selected based on expression variability across multiple datasets. These genes represent key biological pathways including:
\begin{itemize}
\item Immune response genes
\item Cell cycle regulators
\item Metabolic pathway genes
\item Transcription factors
\item Cell surface markers
\end{itemize}
