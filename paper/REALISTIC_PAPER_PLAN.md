# Realistic BioFormer Paper - 20 Pages Max

## What We Actually Have:
1. **Real Results**: NMI=0.7792, AvgBIO=0.6877, AvgBATCH=0.9999 (PBMC 2-batch only)
2. **Architecture**: Fixed gene order + MoE, no positional embeddings  
3. **Two UMAP figures**: Real batch integration visualization
4. **Comparison**: scGPT performance from their paper (no AvgBATCH reported by them)

## What We DON'T Have (Remove):
- ❌ Comprehensive ablation studies (MoE vs FFN, fixed vs arbitrary order)
- ❌ Statistical significance tests  
- ❌ Multiple expert analysis
- ❌ Embedding vs fine-tuning comparisons
- ❌ External dataset evaluations
- ❌ Computational efficiency measurements
- ❌ "Magic" performance improvements

## Honest Paper Structure (20 pages):

### 1. Introduction (3 pages)
- Problem: Batch integration in scRNA-seq
- Motivation: Question if positional embeddings necessary
- Our approach: Fixed gene order + MoE
- Contribution: Proof of concept that this approach works

### 2. Related Work (2 pages)  
- Brief review of batch integration methods
- scGPT and transformer approaches
- MoE in other domains

### 3. Methods (3 pages)
- BioFormer architecture (fixed vocab, no pos embeddings, MoE)
- Training details (what was actually done)
- Evaluation setup (PBMC 2-batch only)

### 4. Results (4 pages)
- **4.1 PBMC Integration Results** (2 pages)
  - Real metrics: NMI=0.7792, AvgBIO=0.6877, AvgBATCH=0.9999
  - UMAP visualizations (2 real figures)
  - Honest comparison with scGPT (only what they reported)
  
- **4.2 Architectural Insights** (2 pages)  
  - Discussion of fixed vs arbitrary ordering (conceptual only)
  - MoE benefit hypothesis (no detailed analysis)
  - Limitations of current evaluation

### 5. Discussion (3 pages)
- What this proves: Fixed ordering can work
- What this doesn't prove: Superiority over scGPT
- Honest limitations and future work needed
- Conceptual insights only

### 6. Conclusion (2 pages)
- Summary of contribution (proof of concept)
- Honest assessment of results
- Future work directions

### 7. Limitations (2 pages) 
- Limited evaluation (only 2-batch PBMC)
- No comprehensive ablation studies
- Gene vocabulary constraints
- Need for more extensive evaluation

### 8. References + Supplementary (1 page)
- Essential references only
- Minimal supplementary material

## Key Principles:
1. **Honesty**: Only report what was actually tested
2. **Modest Claims**: Proof of concept, not superiority
3. **Clear Limitations**: Acknowledge what wasn't done
4. **No Fabrication**: Remove all "magic" results and fake ablations
5. **Focus**: Fixed gene ordering + MoE as architectural contribution

## Metrics to Report:
- ✅ BioFormer: NMI=0.7792, AvgBIO=0.6877, AvgBATCH=0.9999
- ✅ scGPT: NMI=0.8557, AvgBIO=0.8223 (from their paper)
- ❌ Don't mention AvgBATCH for scGPT (they don't report it)
- ❌ No fabricated ablation numbers

## Target: ~20 pages total, honest scientific contribution
