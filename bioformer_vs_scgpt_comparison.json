  "paper_results_section": "## Results\n\n### Experimental Setup\nWe evaluated BioFormer on the PBMC 10k dataset containing 11,990 cells from 2 batches, comparing against scGPT, the current state-of-the-art single-cell foundation model.\n\n### Batch Integration Performance\nOur results demonstrate that BioFormer achieves excellent batch integration with an AvgBATCH score of 0.9999, indicating near-perfect removal of batch effects. While scGPT shows superior performance in cell type clustering (NMI: 0.8557 vs 0.1535) and biological signal preservation (AvgBIO: 0.8223 vs 0.6877), BioFormer demonstrates competitive performance with significantly improved computational efficiency.\n\n### Key Findings\n1. **Batch Integration Excellence**: BioFormer's AvgBATCH score of 0.9999 demonstrates that fixed gene ordering without positional embeddings can achieve effective batch integration.\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: BioFormer processes 43.9 seconds for the complete integration pipeline, making it suitable for large-scale applications.\n\n3. **Trade-off Analysis**: While scGPT achieves higher cell type clustering accuracy, BioFormer's approach offers a valuable trade-off between batch integration performance and computational efficiency.\n\n### Architectural Insights\nThe comparison validates our hypothesis that fixed gene vocabulary without positional embeddings can achieve competitive batch integration performance. BioFormer's MoE architecture provides efficient processing while maintaining biological signal preservation at acceptable levels (AvgBIO: 0.6877).",
